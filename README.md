Computations as I learn data science.

Some stuff is from the book *Doing Data Science* by Rachel Schutt and Cathy O'Neil. For that book, I mostly use the Python libraries `pandas`, `matplotlib` and `numpy`.

The files `r4ds*` are from the book *[R for data science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)*, by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham. For that (obviously) I used R, especially the `tidyverse` package. 

The files `cds*` are from the Spring 2017 class with the [Cornell Data Science Training Program](http://datascienceis.life). These also use R.
